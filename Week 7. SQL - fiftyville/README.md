This is an SQL challenge where you have limited information to start with, you are told only that a crime has been committed somewhere at some time. But fortunately you have access to a lot of information through SQL database. You will have to investigate and access tables to find police reports and clues. And finally look for the persons who match your suspicion, using airport, cell phones and even bank tables.
