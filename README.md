All Project completed on Harvard's course: CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science.
  CS50 is a great course for beginners, not only it prepares you to code, but it does a good job of introducing you to be a programmer, even introducing concepts such as TCP / IP, and understanding the mechanics of the computer world. 
  
  The first 5 weeks the course is going to introduce you to the basics of the C language, all the way up to Data Structures like Binary Trees and Hashtables.
  The following weeks it's going to give you a taste of:
  - Python.
  - SQL.
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
  - Flask.
  
  Although the themes after C are brief, they do a great job to broaden a beginners understanding of coding.
